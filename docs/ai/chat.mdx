# AI Chat

The AI chat is your primary interface for building with Hands. Ask questions, request features, and get help—all in natural language.

## How It Works

Type what you want in the input field. The AI:

1. Understands your request
2. Plans the necessary steps
3. Executes code, SQL, and file changes
4. Shows you the results

```
You: Create a chart showing revenue by month

AI: I'll create a line chart for monthly revenue.

[Writes chart definition to charts/index.ts]
[Adds chart to dashboard page]

Done! The chart is now visible at http://localhost:8787
```

## What You Can Ask For

### Data Questions

```
Show me the top 10 customers
What's our average order value?
How many orders did we get last week?
Find duplicate entries in the users table
```

### Building Features

```
Create a dashboard for sales metrics
Add an API endpoint for customer data
Make a scheduled job to clean old records
Build a webhook handler for Stripe events
```

### Code Changes

```
Add a date filter to the dashboard
Make the table sortable
Change the chart color to blue
Rename the 'amount' column to 'revenue'
```

### Debugging

```
Why is this query slow?
The chart isn't loading - help me fix it
I'm getting a TypeScript error here
```

## Sessions

Each conversation is a **session**. Sessions:

- Maintain context as you work
- Remember what you've discussed
- Track the AI's changes

Start a new session for unrelated tasks:
- Click the + button in the toolbar
- Use `Cmd/Ctrl + T`

Switch between sessions using the chips at the top of the thread.

## Viewing AI Actions

The AI shows what it's doing:

### Tool Invocations

When the AI uses tools, you see them:

```
📖 Read File: src/pages/Dashboard.tsx
📝 Edit File: charts/index.ts
🗄️ SQL Query: SELECT * FROM orders...
💻 Terminal: npm run build
```

Click to expand and see details.

### Reasoning

Sometimes the AI shows its thinking:

```
💭 Reasoning: The user wants to see revenue trends.
I'll need to:
1. Write a SQL query grouping by month
2. Create a line chart definition
3. Add it to the dashboard
```

### Task Lists

For complex requests, the AI creates a task list:

```
☑️ Create the SQL query
☑️ Define the chart
⏳ Add to dashboard
⬜ Style the chart
```

## Tips for Better Results

### Be Specific

```
❌ Make a dashboard
✅ Create a dashboard with revenue, order count, and top products
```

### Provide Context

```
❌ Fix the error
✅ I'm getting "column not found" when the dashboard loads
```

### Ask for Explanations

```
Explain this query before running it
Show me what files you'll change
Walk me through your approach
```

### Iterate

```
Good start, but make the chart wider
Actually, use a bar chart instead
Add a filter for date range
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
