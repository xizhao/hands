# Build Your First Dashboard

In this guide, you'll import sample data and create an interactive sales dashboard.

## What You'll Build

- Import a CSV file into PostgreSQL
- Create multiple chart types
- Build a complete dashboard page
- Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

## Prerequisites

- Hands installed and configured
- An AI provider API key

## Step 1: Create a Workbook

Open Hands and create a new workbook:

1. Click the dropdown in the toolbar
2. Select **New Workbook**
3. Name it "Sales Dashboard"

## Step 2: Import Sample Data

Let's create some sample sales data. In the chat:

```
Create a sample sales dataset with:
- 1000 orders
- Date range: last 12 months
- Fields: order_id, date, customer, product, amount, region
- Realistic product names and amounts
```

The AI will generate and insert the data:

```sql
INSERT INTO orders (order_id, date, customer, product, amount, region)
VALUES
  ('ORD001', '2024-01-15', 'Acme Corp', 'Widget Pro', 299.99, 'West'),
  ...
```

## Step 3: Explore the Data

Ask some questions to understand the data:

```
How many orders do we have?

What's the total revenue?

Show me the top 5 customers by spending
```

## Step 4: Create Your First Chart

```
Create a line chart showing monthly revenue
```

The AI creates a chart definition:

```typescript
// charts/index.ts
export const charts = {
  monthlyRevenue: {
    id: "monthly-revenue",
    title: "Monthly Revenue",
    type: "line",
    query: `
      SELECT
        date_trunc('month', date) as date,
        SUM(amount) as value
      FROM orders
      GROUP BY 1
      ORDER BY 1
    `
  }
};
```

## Step 5: Add More Charts

```
Add these charts:
- Bar chart of sales by region
- Pie chart of top products
- Table of recent orders
```

The AI adds more chart definitions:

```typescript
export const charts = {
  monthlyRevenue: { ... },

  salesByRegion: {
    id: "sales-by-region",
    title: "Sales by Region",
    type: "bar",
    query: `
      SELECT region as name, SUM(amount) as value
      FROM orders
      GROUP BY region
      ORDER BY value DESC
    `
  },

  topProducts: {
    id: "top-products",
    title: "Top Products",
    type: "pie",
    query: `
      SELECT product as name, SUM(amount) as value
      FROM orders
      GROUP BY product
      ORDER BY value DESC
      LIMIT 5
    `
  },

  recentOrders: {
    id: "recent-orders",
    title: "Recent Orders",
    type: "table",
    query: `
      SELECT order_id, date, customer, product, amount
      FROM orders
      ORDER BY date DESC
      LIMIT 20
    `
  }
};
```

## Step 6: Build the Dashboard

```
Create a dashboard page with:
- Header showing total revenue and order count
- Monthly revenue chart at full width
- Sales by region and top products side by side
- Recent orders table at the bottom
```

The AI creates the React component:

```tsx
// src/pages/Dashboard.tsx
export function Dashboard({ data }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-8 space-y-6 bg-gray-50 min-h-screen">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">Sales Dashboard</h1>

      {/* Metrics */}
      <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
        <MetricCard
          title="Total Revenue"
          value={`$${data.totalRevenue.toLocaleString()}`}
        />
        <MetricCard
          title="Orders"
          value={data.orderCount}
        />
        <MetricCard
          title="Avg Order Value"
          value={`$${data.avgOrder.toFixed(2)}`}
        />
      </div>

      {/* Revenue Trend */}
      <Chart chart={charts.monthlyRevenue} data={data.monthlyRevenue} />

      {/* Side by side charts */}
      <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
        <Chart chart={charts.salesByRegion} data={data.salesByRegion} />
        <Chart chart={charts.topProducts} data={data.topProducts} />
      </div>

      {/* Recent Orders */}
      <Table chart={charts.recentOrders} data={data.recentOrders} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Step 7: View Your Dashboard

Your dashboard is now live at:

```
http://localhost:8787
```

Open it in your browser to see your charts!

## Step 8: Add Interactivity

```
Add a date range filter that lets users select last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or all time
```

The AI adds a filter component and updates the queries.

## Step 9: Style Improvements

```
Make the dashboard match our brand:
- Use a dark theme
- Primary color: indigo
- Add card shadows
- More spacing between elements
```

## Step 10: Deploy

When you're happy with your dashboard:

```
Deploy this to Cloudflare
```

Your dashboard is now live! Share the URL with your team.
