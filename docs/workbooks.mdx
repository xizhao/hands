# Workbooks

A workbook is a complete, self-contained data project. Think of it as a folder that contains everything you need to build, test, and deploy a data application.

## What's in a Workbook?

Each workbook includes:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Database" icon="database">
    An embedded PostgreSQL instance with all your data
  </Card>
  <Card title="Code" icon="code">
    Dashboards, API routes, and scheduled jobs
  </Card>
  <Card title="History" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    All your conversations with the AI
  </Card>
  <Card title="Config" icon="gear">
    Deployment settings and environment variables
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Workbook Structure

When you create a workbook, Hands generates this structure:

```
my-workbook/
├── src/
│   ├── index.tsx          # Main app entry (Hono routes)
│   ├── pages/
│   │   └── Dashboard.tsx  # Dashboard React components
│   ├── components/        # Shared UI components
│   └── lib/
│       └── db.ts          # Database utilities
├── charts/
│   └── index.ts           # Chart definitions
├── monitors/              # Scheduled job handlers
├── integrations/          # External data connectors
├── wrangler.toml          # Cloudflare Workers config
├── hands.config.ts        # Hands configuration
└── package.json
```

## Creating Workbooks

### From the App

Click the dropdown in the toolbar and select **New Workbook**. Give it a name and Hands creates everything for you.

### From a Template

Hands includes templates for common use cases:

```
Create a new workbook for tracking sales data

Create an analytics dashboard workbook

Create a workbook for API development
```

## Switching Workbooks

Click the workbook name in the toolbar to see all your workbooks. Selecting a different workbook:

1. Saves your current session
2. Stops the current dev server
3. Opens the new workbook
4. Starts that workbook's dev server

Each workbook's database and code are completely isolated.

## Workbook Settings

### Environment Variables

Set environment variables in `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
[vars]
ENVIRONMENT = "development"
API_KEY = "your-api-key"
```

Or use secrets for sensitive values:

```bash
wrangler secret put API_SECRET
```

### Database Connection

By default, Hands uses an embedded PostgreSQL database. The connection string is:

```
postgresql://hands:hands@localhost:5433/hands_db
```

For production, configure Cloudflare Hyperdrive:

```toml
[[hyperdrive]]
binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
id = "your-hyperdrive-id"
```

## The Dev Server

Each workbook runs a Cloudflare Workers dev server locally. When you open a workbook:

1. Hands starts `wrangler dev`
2. Your app is available at `http://localhost:8787`
3. Changes hot-reload automatically
4. You can see the dev server status in the toolbar

The status indicator shows:
- **Green** - Server running, no errors
- **Yellow** - Server running with warnings
- **Red** - Server stopped or has errors

## Managing Workbooks

### Rename

Right-click the workbook name and select **Rename**.

### Delete

Right-click and select **Delete**. This removes:
- All code and configuration
- The database and all data
- Conversation history

<Warning>
Deletion is permanent. Export important data before deleting.
</Warning>

### Export

Export your workbook as a zip file:

```
Export this workbook
```

This creates a portable archive you can share or backup.

## Multi-Workbook Workflows

Common patterns for organizing workbooks:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Development / Production">
    Create separate workbooks for dev and prod:
    - `sales-dev` - For testing and development
    - `sales-prod` - Production deployment

    Copy configurations between them when promoting changes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Project per Client">
    Give each client their own workbook:
    - `acme-analytics`
    - `globex-dashboard`

    Keep data and code completely isolated.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Experiments">
    Create temporary workbooks for experiments:
    - `test-new-chart-type`
    - `explore-sales-data`

    Delete when done, or promote to a real project.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

  </Card>
</CardGroup>
