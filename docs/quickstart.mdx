  </Step>
</Steps>

## Your First Workbook

Hands creates a default workbook called "My Workbook" on first launch.

A **workbook** is a complete project containing:
- A PostgreSQL database
- Your code (dashboards, APIs, jobs)
- Conversation history with the AI
- Configuration for deployment

## Import Some Data

The easiest way to start is by importing data:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Drag & Drop">
    Drag a CSV, JSON, or Excel file onto the Hands window. The AI will:
    1. Analyze the file structure
    2. Create a database table
    3. Import all the data
    4. Show you what was created
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Ask the AI">
    Type in the chat:
    ```
    Import the data from /path/to/your/file.csv
    ```

    Or use the import agent:
    ```
    @import /path/to/your/file.csv
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Query Your Data

Once imported, ask questions in natural language:

```
Show me the first 10 rows

What are the unique values in the 'status' column?

Calculate the average order value by month
```

The AI writes and executes SQL for you, showing both the query and results.

## Create a Chart

Ask the AI to visualize your data:

```
Create a line chart showing revenue over time

Make a pie chart of sales by category

Build a bar chart comparing this month to last month
```

Charts are defined in code and render in your dashboard.

## Build a Dashboard

Dashboards combine multiple charts into a single view:

```
Create a dashboard with:
- Total revenue as a big number
- Revenue by month as a line chart
- Top 10 products as a table
```

The AI generates:
- A React component for the dashboard
- SQL queries for each chart
- Styling with TailwindCSS

## Run Your App

Your app runs locally with hot reloading:

```
http://localhost:8787
```

The dev server starts automatically when you open a workbook.

## Deploy to Production

When you're ready to go live:

```
Deploy this workbook to Cloudflare
```

Or use the deploy button in the toolbar.

Your app is now running at the edge, accessible worldwide.
