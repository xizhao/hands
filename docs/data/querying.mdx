# Querying Data

Hands lets you query your data using natural language or SQL. The AI translates your questions into optimized queries and presents the results.

## Natural Language Queries

Just ask what you want to know:

```
Show me all orders from last month

What's the average order value by customer?

Find customers who haven't ordered in 90 days

Which products have the highest profit margin?
```

The AI:
1. Understands your question
2. Writes the SQL query
3. Executes it against your database
4. Presents the results

## Viewing SQL

Every query shows the SQL used:

```
You: Show me the top 10 customers by total spending

AI: Here are your top customers:

SELECT
  customer_name,
  SUM(amount) as total_spent,
  COUNT(*) as order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 10;

| customer_name | total_spent | order_count |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Acme Corp    | $125,430    | 47          |
| GlobalTech   | $98,200     | 32          |
| ...          | ...         | ...         |
```

## Writing SQL Directly

You can also write SQL yourself:

```
Run this query:

SELECT date_trunc('month', created_at) as month,
       SUM(amount) as revenue
FROM orders
WHERE status = 'completed'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

Or use the SQL tool directly:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE region = 'West'
```

## Exploring Tables

### List All Tables

```
What tables do I have?

Show me the database schema
```

### Describe a Table

```
Describe the orders table

What columns are in customers?
```

### Sample Data

```
Show me 5 random rows from products

What does the data in orders look like?
```

## Common Query Patterns

### Aggregations

```
Total revenue by month
Average order value per customer
Count of orders by status
```

### Filtering

```
Orders over $1000
Customers in California
Products with low stock (quantity < 10)
```

### Joins

```
Show me orders with customer names

Which products haven't been ordered?

Match invoices with payments
```

### Time-Based Analysis

```
Revenue trend over the last 12 months
Week-over-week growth
Compare this quarter to last quarter
```

## Query History

Your query history is saved in the conversation. Refer to previous results:

```
Filter that last result to only show California

Add the product names to those results

Export that to CSV
```

## Performance Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use LIMIT for exploration">
    When exploring data, start with `LIMIT 100` to avoid loading too much:
    ```
    Show me a sample of 100 rows from the big_table
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Create indexes for common queries">
    If you frequently filter by certain columns:
    ```
    Create an index on orders(customer_id)
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use EXPLAIN for slow queries">
    ```
    Explain why this query is slow:
    SELECT * FROM orders WHERE LOWER(customer_name) LIKE '%acme%'
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Exporting Results

Export query results to files:

```
Export that result to CSV

Download those customers as JSON

Save this report to Excel
```

## Saving Queries

Save frequently-used queries:

```
Save this query as "monthly_revenue"
```

Then reuse them:

```
Run the monthly_revenue query for 2024
```
