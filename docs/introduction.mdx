  <Accordion title="Full-Stack Data Apps" icon="layer-group">
    Build complete applications with:
    - **Dashboards** - Interactive data visualizations
    - **Charts** - Line, bar, pie, area, and table views
    - **API Routes** - HTTP endpoints for your data

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Workbook">
    Each workbook is a complete project with its own database, code, and configuration.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Import Your Data">
    Drag and drop files or use the AI to ingest data from any source. Hands automatically creates tables and infers schemas.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build with AI">
    Ask the AI to analyze data, create visualizations, build APIs, or write any code you need.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy">
    Push to Cloudflare Workers. Your data app is now live and accessible worldwide.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example: From CSV to Dashboard

```
You: Import this sales data and show me revenue by region

AI: I'll import the CSV and create a dashboard for you.

[Creates table 'sales' with columns: date, region, amount, product]
[Generates dashboard with regional breakdown chart]

Your dashboard is ready at http://localhost:8787
```
