description: Interact with your data using natural language
---

Hands includes an AI assistant that understands your data schema and can help you query, analyze, and build applications.

## Chatting with your data

Open the chat panel and type natural language questions:

```
Show me the top 10 customers by revenue
```

The AI will:
1. Analyze your database schema
2. Write the appropriate SQL query
3. Execute it and show results
4. Explain what it found

## What you can ask

### Data exploration

```
What tables do I have?
Show me the schema for the orders table
How many users signed up last month?
```

### Writing queries

```
Write a query to find users who haven't placed an order in 30 days
Calculate the month-over-month growth rate
Find duplicate email addresses
```

### Building dashboards

```
Create a sales dashboard with revenue by month and top products
Add a pie chart showing order status distribution
```

### Data import

```
Import this CSV and create a customers table
Parse the date column as timestamps
Clean up the phone number formatting
```

### Debugging

```
Why is this query slow?
This chart isn't showing data, can you help?
```

## Query generation

When you ask data questions, the AI generates SQL:

**You:** "What's the average order value by customer segment?"

**AI:** Generates and runs:
```sql
SELECT
  c.segment,
  AVG(o.total) as avg_order_value,
  COUNT(*) as order_count
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id
GROUP BY c.segment
ORDER BY avg_order_value DESC
```

The AI knows your schema, so it uses correct table and column names.

## Context awareness

The AI maintains context throughout your conversation:

**You:** "Show me sales from last week"
**AI:** *shows sales data*

**You:** "Now break it down by category"
**AI:** *adds GROUP BY category to the previous query*

**You:** "Export that as a chart"
**AI:** *creates a bar chart from the grouped results*

## Asking for explanations

Get explanations of complex queries or concepts:

```
Explain what this window function does
Why did you use a CTE here?
What's the difference between LEFT JOIN and INNER JOIN?
```

## Code generation

The AI can generate code beyond SQL:

```
Create an API endpoint that returns customer data
Write a scheduled job to send daily reports
Generate a TypeScript type for the orders table
```

## Tips for better results

1. **Be specific** - "Show revenue by month for 2024" is better than "show me revenue"
2. **Mention tables** - "From the orders table, find..." helps if you have similar columns
3. **Provide context** - "I'm building a dashboard for the sales team..." helps the AI understand your goal
4. **Ask follow-ups** - Build on previous queries instead of starting fresh

## Limitations

The AI works best for:
- SQL query generation
- Data exploration
- Simple dashboard creation
- Code explanations

For complex application logic, you may want to write code directly.

## Privacy

- Your data stays in your local workbook
- Only schema information is sent to the AI for context
- Query results are processed locally
