Tools are capabilities that the AI can use to help you. They allow the AI to query data, write files, run commands, and interact with external services.

## Built-in tools

### SQL Query

The AI can execute SQL queries against your database:

```
What's the total revenue by month?
```

The AI uses the SQL tool to:
1. Generate the query
2. Execute it
3. Return formatted results

### File Operations

Read and write files in your workbook:

```
Create a new dashboard in src/dashboards/sales.ts
Show me the contents of hands.config.ts
```

### Bash Commands

Run shell commands (when permitted):

```
Install the zod package
Run the tests
```

### Web Fetch

Fetch data from external URLs:

```
Get the current exchange rates from this API
```

## Tool permissions

Tools can be enabled or disabled per agent:

```yaml
# In agent frontmatter
tools:
  write: true    # File writing
  bash: true     # Shell commands
  sql: true      # Database queries
  fetch: true    # HTTP requests
```

### Default permissions

The main chat assistant has:
- `sql: true` - Can query your data
- `write: true` - Can create/edit files
- `bash: false` - Cannot run commands by default
- `fetch: true` - Can fetch URLs

## SQL tool details

### Query execution

The SQL tool runs queries and returns results:

```typescript
// Behind the scenes
const results = await sql`
  SELECT category, SUM(revenue) as total
  FROM sales
  GROUP BY category
`;
```

### Schema awareness

The AI knows your database schema:

- Table names and columns
- Column types
- Primary keys and relationships
- Sample data (first few rows)

This lets it write accurate queries without you specifying details.

### Safety

- Queries are parameterized to prevent injection
- Write operations require confirmation
- Long-running queries have timeouts

## File tool details

### Reading files

The AI can read any file in your workbook:

```
Show me the dashboard configuration
What's in the utils folder?
```

### Writing files

When writing files, the AI:
1. Shows you the proposed changes
2. Waits for confirmation
3. Creates or updates the file

```
Create a new API route for products
```

### File patterns

The AI understands common patterns:
- Dashboard files in `src/dashboards/`
- API routes in `src/api/`
- Jobs in `src/jobs/`
- Config in `hands.config.ts`

## Bash tool details

When enabled, the AI can run shell commands:

### Safe commands

Always allowed:
- `ls`, `pwd`, `cat`
- `npm install`, `bun add`
- `git status`, `git log`

### Dangerous commands

Require explicit permission:
- File deletion
- System modifications
- Network operations

### Permission configuration

```yaml
# In agent frontmatter
permission:
  bash:
    "npm *": "allow"
    "rm *": "deny"
    "*": "ask"    # Prompt for other commands
```

## Fetch tool details

Fetch data from external services:

### GET requests

```
Fetch the API documentation from https://api.example.com/docs
```

### POST requests

```
Send this data to the webhook: {...}
```

### Authentication

The AI can use environment variables for auth:

```
Use the API_KEY environment variable to authenticate
```

## Custom tools

You can define custom tools for your workbook:

```typescript
// .opencode/tool/lookup-customer.ts
import { sql } from '@hands/stdlib';

export default {
  name: 'lookup_customer',
  description: 'Look up a customer by email',
  parameters: {
    email: { type: 'string', description: 'Customer email' }
  },
  async execute({ email }) {
    const customer = await sql`
      SELECT * FROM customers WHERE email = ${email}
    `;
    return customer[0];
  }
};
```

Now the AI can use this tool:

```
Look up the customer with email john@example.com
```

## Tool output

Tools return structured data that the AI interprets:

- **SQL**: Array of row objects
- **File read**: File contents as string
- **Bash**: stdout/stderr output
- **Fetch**: Response body

The AI formats this appropriately in its response.

## Next steps

- Create custom [Agents](/ai/agents/) with specific tools
- Build [Dashboards](/apps/dashboards/) with AI assistance
