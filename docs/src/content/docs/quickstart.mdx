description: Create your first Hands workbook in 5 minutes
---

import { Steps, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This guide walks you through creating your first Hands workbook, importing data, and building a simple dashboard.

## Prerequisites

- Hands desktop app installed
- Sample data (we'll use a CSV file)

## Create a workbook

<Steps>
1. **Open Hands** and click "New Workbook"
2. **Choose a location** for your workbook folder
3. **Name your workbook** - this will be the folder name
</Steps>

Hands creates a new folder with the following structure:

```
my-workbook/
├── hands.config.ts    # Configuration
├── src/
│   └── index.ts       # Entry point
└── data/              # Local data files
```

## Import data

You can import data through the AI chat or by placing files in the `data/` folder.

### Using AI chat

Type in the chat:

```
Import users.csv and create a users table
```

The AI will:
1. Read your CSV file
2. Infer the schema
3. Create the table
4. Load the data

### Manual import

Place your CSV in the `data/` folder and use SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users AS
SELECT * FROM read_csv('data/users.csv');
```

## Query your data

Once imported, you can query with SQL:

```typescript
import { sql } from '@hands/stdlib';

const activeUsers = await sql`
  SELECT * FROM users
  WHERE status = 'active'
  ORDER BY created_at DESC
  LIMIT 10
`;
```

## Create a chart

Add a chart to visualize your data:

```typescript
import { dashboard } from '@hands/stdlib';

export default dashboard({
  title: 'User Dashboard',
  charts: [
    {
      title: 'Users by Status',
      type: 'pie',
      query: `
        SELECT status as name, COUNT(*) as value
        FROM users
        GROUP BY status
      `
    }
  ]
});
```

## Run your dashboard

Click the "Run" button or press `Cmd+Enter` to see your dashboard in the preview panel.

## Deploy (optional)

Ready to share? Click "Deploy" to push your dashboard to Cloudflare Workers. You'll get a public URL you can share with anyone.
