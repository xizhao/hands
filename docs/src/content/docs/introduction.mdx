description: What is Hands and why you should use it
---

Hands is a desktop application for building data-driven applications. It combines the power of SQL databases with AI assistance to help you analyze data, build dashboards, and deploy applications.

## What can you build?

- **Dashboards** - Create real-time visualizations with charts and tables
- **Data Pipelines** - Transform and process data with scheduled jobs
- **API Backends** - Build REST APIs that query your data
- **AI Agents** - Create custom agents that work with your data

## How it works

1. **Import your data** - Load CSV, JSON, or connect to external databases
2. **Query with SQL** - Write queries against your embedded PostgreSQL database
3. **Build your app** - Use the stdlib to create dashboards, monitors, and APIs
4. **Deploy** - One-click deployment to Cloudflare Workers

## Core concepts

### Workbooks

A workbook is a project that contains your data, queries, and applications. Each workbook has:

- An embedded PostgreSQL database
- A `hands.config.ts` configuration file
- Source files for your dashboards and APIs

### The stdlib

The Hands standard library (`@hands/stdlib`) provides functions for building applications:

```typescript
import { sql, monitor, dashboard, integration } from '@hands/stdlib';

// Query your data
const users = await sql`SELECT * FROM users`;

// Create a dashboard
export default dashboard({
  title: 'User Analytics',
  charts: [...]
});
```

### AI Assistance

Chat with the AI to:

- Write SQL queries from natural language
- Generate dashboard configurations
- Debug and optimize your code
- Import and transform data
