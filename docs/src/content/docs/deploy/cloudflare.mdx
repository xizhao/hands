title: Deploy to Cloudflare
description: Deploy your Hands apps to Cloudflare Workers
---

Hands deploys your applications to Cloudflare Workers, giving you global edge distribution with low latency.

## One-click deploy

The easiest way to deploy:

1. Click the **Deploy** button in the toolbar
2. Sign in to Cloudflare (first time only)
3. Wait for the build to complete
4. Get your public URL

Your app is now live at `https://your-app.workers.dev`.

## What gets deployed

When you deploy, Hands builds and uploads:

- **Dashboards** - Rendered as static HTML with interactive charts
- **API routes** - Hono handlers as Worker functions
- **Scheduled jobs** - Configured as Cloudflare Cron Triggers
- **Static assets** - CSS, JS, and images

## Prerequisites

You'll need a Cloudflare account. The free tier includes:
- 100,000 Worker requests/day
- 10ms CPU time per request
- Unlimited deployments

## First deployment

On your first deploy:

1. Hands opens Cloudflare OAuth
2. Authorize the Hands app
3. Select or create a Workers project
4. Deploy completes

Subsequent deploys are automatic with no prompts.

## Custom domains

After deploying, add a custom domain:

1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard > Workers
2. Select your Worker
3. Go to Triggers > Custom Domains
4. Add your domain

Your DNS must be managed by Cloudflare.

## Environment variables

Set secrets and environment variables:

### In Hands

```typescript
// hands.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  vars: {
    PUBLIC_API_URL: 'https://api.example.com'
  }
});
```

### Secrets (sensitive values)

Use the Cloudflare dashboard or Wrangler CLI:

```bash
wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL
```

Access in your code:

```typescript
// Secrets are available in the environment
const dbUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL;
```

## Database in production

Your local embedded database doesn't deploy. For production data:

### Option 1: Cloudflare D1

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from '@hands/stdlib';

export default defineConfig({
  database: {
    type: 'd1',
    name: 'my-database'
  }
});
```

### Option 2: External database

Connect to an external PostgreSQL:

```typescript
import { integration } from '@hands/stdlib';

const db = integration({
  type: 'postgres',
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL
});
```

### Option 3: Read-only data

Export your local data and include it in the build:

```typescript
// Build-time data embedding
import data from './data/products.json';
```

## Deployment configuration

### wrangler.toml

Hands generates `wrangler.toml` automatically:

```toml
name = "my-workbook"
main = "dist/worker.js"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-01"

[triggers]
crons = ["0 9 * * *"]
```

### Custom configuration

Override settings in `hands.config.ts`:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  deploy: {
    name: 'my-custom-name',
    routes: ['example.com/*'],
    compatibilityDate: '2024-01-01'
  }
});
```

## Viewing logs

See your Worker logs:

### In Cloudflare Dashboard

1. Go to Workers > your Worker
2. Click "Logs" tab
3. View real-time logs

### With Wrangler

```bash
wrangler tail
```

## Rollback

To rollback to a previous version:

1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard > Workers
2. Select your Worker
3. Go to Deployments
4. Click "Rollback" on a previous version

## CI/CD integration

Deploy from CI using Wrangler:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
      - run: bun install
      - run: bun run build
      - uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@v3
        with:
          apiToken: ${{ secrets.CF_API_TOKEN }}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails

Check for TypeScript errors:
```bash
bun run typecheck
```

### Worker size limit

Cloudflare Workers have a 1MB limit. If exceeded:
- Remove unused dependencies
- Use dynamic imports
- Split into multiple Workers

### Cold starts

First request after idle may be slow. To reduce:
- Use Cloudflare's Smart Placement
- Keep Workers warm with scheduled pings

## Next steps

- Configure [Environment variables](/deploy/configuration/)
- Set up [Scheduled jobs](/apps/scheduled-jobs/)
